    blogDescription: [
      `
    Thomas Tuchel has been appointed as the new Chelsea Head Coach. 
    He moves to Stamford Bridge following a two-and-a-half year spell at 
    French champions Paris Saint-Germain, which came to an end last month.`,

      `He will be the first German to manage Chelsea and arrives having guided 
    PSG to four major honours and the Champions League final during his time in the French capital.
    Prior to that, he spent seven seasons coaching in the Bundesliga, 
    first with Mainz, where he led them into the Europa League, 
    and then a successful period with Borussia Dortmund where he won the German Cup.`,

      `
    At Chelsea, he will be reunited with Christian Pulisic and Thiago Silva who 
    he coached during his spells in Dortmund and Paris respectively.`,
      `
    Tuchel, who has signed an 18-month contract with the possibility 
    of an extension, said: ‘I would like to thank Chelsea FC for their confidence in me and my staff.
    ‘We all have the greatest respect for Frank Lampard’s work and 
    the legacy he created at Chelsea. At the same time, I cannot wait to meet my new team and 
    compete in the most exciting league in football. 
    I am grateful to now be part of the Chelsea family - it feels amazing!’
    `,
      `
    Director Marina Granovskaia added: ‘It is never easy to change Head Coach 
    in the middle of the season but we are very happy to secure one of Europe’s best coaches in Thomas Tuchel. 
    There is still much to play for and much to achieve, this season and beyond. We welcome Thomas to the Club.’
    Tuchel will take his first training session this evening and will be in the dugout for 
    tomorrow’s Premier League game against Wolves.

    blogTitle: "Spurs thrashed by struggling Liverpool side.",

      "After difficult few weeks Reds have won convincingly at spurs.",
    blogDescription: [
      `
    Liverpool returned to form in impressive fashion as the Premier League champions secured a 
    convincing victory at Tottenham Hotspur.
    After a run of five league games without a win - four of those without a goal - 
    Liverpool moved back into the top four as they discovered their cutting edge in 
    style at the expense of an uninspiring Spurs.
    Spurs, who lost striker Harry Kane to an ankle injury at half-time, 
    had an early Son Heung-min strike ruled out for offside before Liverpool's 
    threat was rewarded with their first league goal in 482 minutes in first-half stoppage time.
    `,
      `
    Brazil striker Roberto Firmino took advantage of hesitation between 
    Eric Dier and Hugo Lloris to tap in Sadio Mane's low cross from close range.
    France keeper Lloris was at fault again two minutes after the break when 
    he pushed Mane's shot into the path of right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who finished emphatically.
    Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's 20-yard strike gave Spurs hope almost 
    immediately but Liverpool were always in control of an entertaining second period.
    `,
      `
    Jose Mourinho spent much of the second half bellowing instructions at 
    his Spurs players in an attempt to spark a reaction - 
    but it was to no avail as they produced a lacklustre performance.
    Liverpool always carried a greater threat once 
    Son's early finish was ruled out for VAR but it was a moment of indecision between 
    Dier and Lloris that opened the door for Firmino right at the end of the first half.
    `,
      `
    The lack of threat was perhaps less surprising after the loss of Kane, 
    who twice received treatment for ankle knocks before eventually succumbing 
    to the second one on his left ankle which was sustained in an innocuous challenge with Henderson.
    Mourinho suggested after the match Kane may miss "a few weeks" and on this 
    evidence Spurs will struggle to be anywhere near their best without their talisman and leading marksman.

      "Red devils has missed an opportunity to move to top of the table after dissapointing home loss.",
    blogDescription: [
      `
      Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has joked many times this season that his 
      Manchester United side like to do things the hard way, and they couldn’t have made life more 
      difficult for themselves during a dreadful 2-1 loss at home to Sheffield United on Wednesday night.
      It was always likely that if they kept falling behind in games, their combination of luck, 
      grit and determination would eventually prove unable to bail them out of trouble. 
      The only surprise was that it happened at Old Trafford against the bottom team in the Premier League.
      `,
      `
      While there was genuine hope they could mount one of their now-famous
      comebacks when Harry Maguire powered home a second-half equaliser, 
      United were ultimately undone by abysmal defending, with Oliver Burke firing home the winner 
      with 16 minutes to go after the hosts had squandered a succession of chances to clear the ball.
      `,
      `
      Solskjaer had been hoping that Sunday's dramatic FA Cup win over bitter rivals 
      Liverpool would prove a pivotal moment in the season, 
      as it gave his players the win over a big-six side that 
      they had been craving since the start of the 2020-21 campaign.
      However, United have little hope of winning trophies if they do 
      not address their maddening propensity for starting games slowly, 
      as they did once again on Wednesday night.
      `,
      `
      Of course, one defeat isn’t enough to start writing off United's title chances, 
      in the same way that a string of wins wasn’t 
      enough to back them to finish top of the pile. 
      However, no matter what their targets are, they 
      cannot afford more anaemic performances like this.
      In a season of unpredictable and surprising results 
      anything is still possible but we will now see what
      Solskjaer's side is made of, as this is a true test of character.

      `
      Fueled by a sparkling attacking display, Manchester City's players powered to 
      the top of the Premier League for the first time this season — 
      and even the opposition are stopping to admire their work.
      In a comical exhibit for VAR's ever-lengthening highlights reel, 
      West Bromwich Albion's defenders virtually stopped in their tracks 
      and looked on as Joao Cancelo curled a shot into the top corner 
      for the second of City's goals in a 5-0 rout on Tuesday.
      `,
      `
      Make it seven straight wins in the league — and 11 in all competitions — 
      for City in an ominous run of results. 
      City became the ninth side to finish a day 
      in first place this season, the most within a single top-flight campaign since 1986-87.
      Even if Manchester United reclaims the lead on 
      Wednesday by beating Sheffield United, City — 
      on its longest winning run in more than three 
      years — looks to be the team to beat.
      `,
      `
      City were without Kevin de Bruyne, Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus - introduced at 5-0 - 
      and had no out-and-out forward in their team, and still could have scored more goals in an 11th straight win.
      Phil Foden had already had a shot turned on to the 
      post when the superb Gundogan controlled a pass over 
      the top, swivelled and clipped the ball into the far corner in one fluid movement.
      `,
      `Then came the game's bizarre second goal.
      Sian Massey-Ellis flagged Bernardo Silva offside as he was played in down the right. His cutback to 
      Cancelo was chipped into the top corner, with the flag still raised and some players stationary.`,
      `
      A VAR check confirmed Bernardo was in fact onside and the goal stood, to Allardyce's disbelief.
      "Listen we all make mistakes," he said. "She made a mistake and put her flag up too soon.
      "You can't tell me that rubbish about playing to the whistle, 
      that's nonsense, if the flag goes up you naturally stop. 
      But saying that, she made one mistake. We made far more today."

    blogTitle: "Pogba remains silent on contract situation.",
    blogShortDescription:
      "Pogba has refused to talk about contract situation at Mufc.",
    blogDescription: [
      `
      Paul Pogba has confirmed he is planning to hold talks with the Man Utd board over his contract.
      The French midfielder's future has been the subject of debate after his agent, Mino Raiola, 
      claimed last month that he was "unhappy" at Old Trafford.
      Since then Pogba has produced some of his best form in a United shirt 
      and looks happier in his surroundings.
      Nevertheless, his contract is due to expire at the end of 
      next season, meaning United will need to make a decision 
      on his future this summer or risk losing him for nothing.
      `,
      `
      "Now my objective, my goal is to 
      win something that’s all I’m thinking about is to win, 
      bring my energy, do the best I can to help the team the most.
      "That's all I'm thinking of. The contract is not important, just to win."
      Pogba has never commented on Raiola's claims 
      made at the start of December, where the agent 
      stated the 28-year-old had "no intentions" of extending his United deal.
      Raiola told Tuttosport at the time: "Paul is unhappy. 
      He is no longer able to express himself as he would like and as expected of him.
      `,
      `
      Discussing Pogba's future to ESPN , United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said earlier this month: 
      "Paul has been here now for a while and, of course, he wants to win more trophies.
      "He's got a very, very good attitude to training and playing football.
      "He loves football, he's ambitious, he wants to have success -
       like most of the others that are in the squad."
       That is now Pogba's short-term goal, and whether United collect 
       any silverware this season could prove to be a deciding factor in whether he stays put.
      `,
      `
      Pogba added: "From last year and this year I would say it’s surprising [United's progress] 
      but we were expecting to get closer, that's the goal, the challenge to get to the top.

    blogTitle: "Kane injured for 2 games.",
    blogShortDescription:
      "Harry Kane came limping off in first half against Liverpool.",
    blogDescription: [
      `
      There were three changes at halftime of 
      Liverpool’s 3-1 away win over Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday, and two of them will raise eyebrows.
      The one that won’t is the removal of Serge Aurier,
       who was poor in the first half and one of the 
       main culprits of Roberto Firmino’s opener just before halftime.
      `,
      `
      The exits of Harry Kane and Joel Matip, however, will be monitored by both teams.
      Kane spent two spells on the turf in the first half, 
      leaving the pitch after several minutes of treatment early in the half but returning.
      “Two ankles,” said Jose Mourinho after the game. 
      “The first was a bad tackle, I think Thiago. The second 
      I didn’t know well but two injuries, the second one worse 
      than the first one and a few weeks. How many? I don’t know. … 
      There are some players that 
      you can’t replace and almost every tea has this kind of player. 
      We have to fight against it and that’s it.”
      `,
      `
      Spurs’ star striker was then injured going for an aerial ball 
      with Jordan Henderson and did not return to the pitch after halftime.
      He’s faced a number of injury absences in the past 
      few years but has been a lethal finisher when healthy. 
      Kane has 19 goals and 14 assists in 28 appearances this season.
      `,
      `
      Mourinho lamented the loss of his irreplaceable talisman 
      as he provided an update on the potential double ankle injury the 27-year-old sustained
      "Two ankles, the first was a bad tackle, 
      it was Thiago, the second one I didn't know well," Mourinho told BBC Radio 5 Live .
